DESCRIPTION
     *) used by experts

     Trace can be initiated in different ways. Trace on unit, trace
     on signal sequence or trace on directory number. To start a trace
     the first command shall contain a directory number or a lim and
     unit number, it may have additional parameters, the printout
     returned shows the tri number assigned to your trace session.
     If only lim and unit parameters are stated, a unit trace is started.
     If message number is added to lim and unit a sequence trace is
     started. If a directory number or equ is used a sequence trace
     is started for the next call.
     Tracing on mgw or bpos starts trace on the hw position (wilma
     trace). Each signal is printed two times, if the equipment position
     is initiated. On signals to hw the sw format is printed first
     and on signals from hw the hw format is printed first. If hw
     is not assigned on signals from hw only the first format is printed
     as the signal is not forwarded anywhere.

EXAMPLES
     DIRECTORY TRACE
          example% trace -dir 2000

     UNIT TRACE
          example% trace -lim 66 -unit CMP

     SEQUENCE TRACE
          example% trace -lim 1 -unit CMP -signo 33

     START TRACE
          example% trace -start 2

     STOP TRACE
          example% trace -stop 2

     PRINT TRACE
          example% trace -print 2

     PRINT TRACE WITH FROMTIME PARAMETER SPECIFIED
          example% trace -print 2 -fromtime "2013-07-01 12:45:00 (CEST)"

     REMOVE TRACE
          example% trace -remove 2

NOTES
     "trace -print 0" prints diagnostic history log
     In most parameters, different notations for input can be used.
     Decadic notation starts with a digit, octal with "0" and hexadecimal
     values with "0x"
     "trace -attach X" prints data as signals arrive from the traced
     object. This can create LOTS of signals in the system, so be
     careful when selecting targets.
     Attach or print when trace is started on LOGGER should not be
     done as it will give circular printouts, i.e. the printout will
     start to print the printsignals.
     Due to signalling restrictions trace -attach on all lims are
     only allowed on for history log. If attaching any other trace
     individual the user should log on to the attached lim.Trace "all"
     can be cleared, stopped and (re)started by adding servicecodes:
     SC-190 to clear, SC-191 to stop and SC-192 (re)start
